# node-ts-playground

## Pre Requisites
Install NPM and Node.js. The best way to that is to use a tool called NVM: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

## Setup
0. open a new terminal session
1. clone the repo and cd into root dir
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build:watch`
4. open another new terminal session and run `npm run nodemon`

Now when you edit and save `index.ts`, this file will get compiled to the `build` directory and executed automatically.
